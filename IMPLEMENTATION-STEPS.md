# Implementation Steps - 2-Layer Build

**Estimated time: 60 minutes total**

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Create Public Standard Image Repo (DONE)

Files created in `/tmp/bytebot-standard/`:
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Builds desktop + standard bytebotd
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Excludes computer-control
- ✅ `.github/workflows/build-standard.yml` - Automated weekly builds
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Push to GitHub (5 min)

### Step 1: Create GitHub repo

```bash
# Go to https://github.com/new
# Repository name: bytebot-standard
# Description: Public desktop environment + standard bytebotd
# Visibility: PUBLIC
# Initialize: NO (we already have files)
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub PAT for Actions

The workflow needs access to your private `bytebot-agent-desktop` repo:

```bash
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
# 2. Name: "GitHub Actions - bytebot-standard"
# 3. Expiration: 90 days
# 4. Scopes: Select "repo" (full control of private repos)
# 5. Generate token
# 6. Copy token (starts with ghp_)

# 7. Add as secret to bytebot-standard repo:
#    Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
#    Name: GH_PAT
#    Value: ghp_xxxxx
```

### Step 3: Push files

```bash
cd /tmp/bytebot-standard

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: 2-layer build standard image"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/elsa17z/bytebot-standard.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Result:** GitHub Actions will start building (~18 min)

---

## 📦 Phase 3: Make Package Public (2 min)

Wait for GitHub Actions to complete, then:

```bash
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/elsa17z?tab=packages
# 2. Click: bytebot-standard
# 3. Click: Package settings (top right)
# 4. Scroll to: Danger Zone > Change visibility
# 5. Click: "Change visibility"
# 6. Select: Public
# 7. Type: bytebot-standard
# 8. Click: "I understand, change package visibility"
```

**Verify public access:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/elsa17z/bytebot-standard:latest
# Should work without authentication
```

---

## 🔧 Phase 4: Update Private Repo (10 min)

### Step 1: Backup current Dockerfile

```bash
cd /tmp/bytebot-agent-desktop-setup

# Backup
cp Dockerfile Dockerfile.monolithic.backup
```

### Step 2: Use new 2-layer Dockerfile

```bash
# Copy the new minimal Dockerfile
cp Dockerfile.2layer Dockerfile

# Verify
cat Dockerfile | head -20
```

### Step 3: Update railway.json

```bash
cat > railway.json << 'EOF'
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
EOF
```

### Step 4: Commit and push

```bash
git add Dockerfile Dockerfile.monolithic.backup railway.json
git commit -m "feat: 2-layer build - 2 min builds (90% faster than 20 min monolithic)

BEFORE:
- 20 min build per service
- 10 services = 200 minutes (3+ hours)

AFTER:
- 2 min build per service
- 10 services = 20 minutes (90% faster!)

ARCHITECTURE:
- Layer 1 (PUBLIC): Desktop + standard bytebotd (ghcr.io/elsa17z/bytebot-standard)
- Layer 2 (PRIVATE): Computer-control module only (built from this repo)

PRIVACY:
- Computer-control stays private (built on Railway, never pushed)
- Desktop + standard bytebotd is public (no proprietary code)
"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Test with One Service (5 min)

### Test deployment

```bash
# Create test agent
curl -X POST https://bytebot-orchestrator-production.up.railway.app/computer-control \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Agent-ID: 2LAYER-TEST-001" \
  -d '{"action":"screenshot"}' \
  | jq .
```

### Monitor Railway logs

Expected output:
```
✓ Cloning elsa17z/bytebot-agent-desktop
✓ Reading Dockerfile
✓ Pulling ghcr.io/elsa17z/bytebot-standard:latest (PUBLIC, no auth needed)
  [===================] 2.1 GB / 2.1 GB (15 sec)
✓ Using cached layers from base image
✓ Copying computer-control module
✓ Building TypeScript (2 min)
✓ Build complete: 2 min 18 sec
✓ Deploying...
✓ Service ready
```

### Verify success

```bash
# Should complete in ~2.5 minutes (vs 20 minutes before!)
# Screenshot should be returned successfully
```

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Verification Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Actions built standard image successfully (~18 min)
- [ ] Package is public (can pull without auth)
- [ ] Private repo Dockerfile updated
- [ ] Test service deployed in ~2 minutes
- [ ] Screenshot API works
- [ ] Railway logs show "Pulling ghcr.io/elsa17z/bytebot-standard" (not building)

---

## 🚀 Phase 7: Production Rollout

Once test succeeds:

```bash
# Orchestrator code needs NO CHANGES!
# It already builds from elsa17z/bytebot-agent-desktop

# Just create services as normal:
curl -X POST .../computer-control \
  -H "X-Agent-ID: PROD-AGENT-001" \
  -d '{"action":"screenshot"}'

# Each service will now deploy in 2 minutes instead of 20!
```

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Weekly standard image rebuild (automated)

GitHub Actions runs every Sunday at midnight:
- Pulls latest from bytebot-agent-desktop
- Excludes computer-control
- Builds and pushes standard image
- Takes ~18 minutes
- Zero manual work ✅

### When to manually trigger rebuild

```bash
# If you update desktop apps or standard bytebotd:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/elsa17z/bytebot-standard/actions
# 2. Click: "Build ByteBot Standard Image"
# 3. Click: "Run workflow" > "Run workflow"
# 4. Wait ~18 minutes
# 5. New services will automatically use latest image
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub Actions fails with "Permission denied"

**Cause:** GH_PAT not configured or expired

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Create new PAT (see Phase 2, Step 2)
# 2. Update secret: Settings > Secrets > GH_PAT > Update
# 3. Re-run workflow
```

### Issue: "computer-control module not found" in Layer 2 build

**Cause:** Dockerfile.2layer trying to copy files that don't exist

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check files exist in private repo:
ls -la /tmp/bytebot-agent-desktop-setup/packages/bytebotd/src/computer-control/
ls -la /tmp/bytebot-agent-desktop-setup/docker/scripts/

# Verify paths in Dockerfile match actual structure
```

### Issue: Railway still building for 20 minutes

**Cause:** Using old Dockerfile

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify Railway is using new Dockerfile:
cd /tmp/bytebot-agent-desktop-setup
git log -1 --stat | grep Dockerfile

# If not pushed, push again:
git push origin main

# Delete old service, create new one to force rebuild
```

## 📝 Next Steps After Success

1. **Document for team:** Share this guide
2. **Monitor build times:** Track Railway deployment logs
3. **Scale up:** Create more services (now 90% faster!)
4. **Celebrate:** 10 services in 20 min instead of 3+ hours! 🎉

---

**Total implementation time:** ~60 minutes (mostly waiting for builds)
**Ongoing time savings:** 18 minutes per service (90% faster)
**Break-even:** After 4 services deployed
